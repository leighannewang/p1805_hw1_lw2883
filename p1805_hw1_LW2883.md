# Problem 1

Creating a data frame with variables

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_sample = rnorm(10),
  norm_sample_pos = norm_sample > 0
)
```

Finding the mean of each variable in data frame

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_sample))
## [1] -0.335643
mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_sample_pos))
## [1] 0.3
```

Applying as.numeric function to logical, character, and factor variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, norm_sample_pos))
##  [1] 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
```

# Problem 2

Load the penguins dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

summary(penguins)
```

Description of Data Set
