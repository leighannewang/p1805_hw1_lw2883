# Problem 1

Creating a data frame with variables

```{r, problem1_df}
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_sample = rnorm(10),
  norm_sample_pos = norm_sample > 0
)
```
Finding the mean of each variable in data frame

* The mean of norm_sample is **`r mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_sample))`**
* The mean of norm_sample_pos is **`r mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_sample_pos))`**
